# TouchCounter
A simple Android app for counting heartbeats per minute, for example in Biology experiments.

This app was created in the context of a bachelor's thesis where the heartbeat of Daphnia magna was meassured around exposition to neurotoxins such as Dimethoat and Nicotine.

Building the app should only require a recent version of Android Studio.
